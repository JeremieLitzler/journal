title: Support my work sharing more notes and experiences
description: Taking notes from the large amount of worthwhile vlogs to watch needs time. I’m doing it because I want to learn more about the topics of web technologies, health, permaculture & more. If you want to thank me through a participation, it will be highly appreciated and it will help provide more content to you, dear reader.

When I started this blog, I had a goal in mind: take notes as much as I can to be able to build a knowledge base for my family’s projects towards more autonomy in many areas of life.

I discovered many awesome authors and individuals throughout the years and YouTube provides a lot of opportunities to learn.

From Charles Dowding to Huw Richards in the UK to Damien Dekarz and Kévin from the channel _Comme un pingouin dans le désert_, we can watch and learn from more 3000 vlogs.

Primarily, I offer here a summary of those vlogs in a written form. You will learn as much as if you had watched the whole vlog but spending half the time.

I always provide the link to the vlog so you’re free to watch it and I include a lot of graphic assets of the vlog to provide context, always to the credit of the original author.

Now, if you like what I do and think it’s worth your support, you can take one of the following actions.

## How to help me in this effort

You can help me further by sending me any amount available below in the currency that suits you the best:

- in Euros,
- in US dollars,
- in British pounds
- in Swiss francs.

Each link will take you to Stripe page, the payment provider I have chosen. You will pay no more the amount selected, providing that you pick a currency that is compatible with your payment method. Otherwise, I invite you to check with your bank about the additional fees you may pay.

Or, if you need any other currency, [just let me know](../contact-me/README.md). It will take me a few minutes to a currency that Stripe supports.

### Participate with a tip

Starting at 5 euros (or the available currencies), you can also provide your support from 5 euros per month to 50 euros per year.
