Everyone has a story. This is mine. So far.

I have created this website to record notes and experiences worth sharing because I had a _ahhh_ moment.

## Career

In 2009, I started my career.
From Trust5 in Ireland to Conduent Business Solutions in France, I am passionate about improving the daily life of businesses, individuals and more through web-based applications and services.

I have acquired a wide range of skills in software development for the Web and I thrive to learn new tricks every day.

For more details about my work experience and skill, come read [my resume here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ywInLK5Y-LkL-0dbkaH0B6Dx927PDEHRz9yzUPWNgBY).

## What will you find here

Among those topics:

- Web fundamentals
- Course review I have taken
- Software product review I have used
- Web development tips
- Work organisation
<!-- - Team management -->

## And also my hobbies

Outside of the software engineering world, I am learning more and more to have a sustainable lifestyle, for me and my family.

Also, I will review products I have purchased and used for a long time as well as those I wouldn't recommend.

It includes and is not limited to:

- Awareness about health and diet
- Use of energy
- Gardening
- Product reviews that I have purchased once or more

## What else

With my lovely wife and real twin girls, we live in the beautiful Rhone valley in the south of France.
