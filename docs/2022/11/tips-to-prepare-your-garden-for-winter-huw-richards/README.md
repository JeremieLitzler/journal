## Plant garlic

Huw always felt that planting garlic before Christmas in his UK climate worked best.

There are so many ways to enjoy garlic:

- green garlic,
- dried garlic

## Move plants into your polytunnel

If you own one… ;)

It’s a far more favorable environment to grow your winter vegetables.

## Clear your beds

Leave the roots in the grown.

Try to remove the weeds!

## Pick up dead leaves

:::tip Personal note

I’m currently working on that, for the third year.

I already covered some parts of my garden with a thick and yet light _duvet of dead leaves_ for the winter.

It serves at least two purposes:

- keep the ground warmer and covered
- help the soil life thrive even in winter

This year, I’m planning to gather a lot more than the previous year. At the time of this writing, I have gathered 6 meters cubes already.

## Collect grass clippings

![Mix of grass clippings and leaves](./images/tip-5-collect-grass-clippings.jpg 'Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

Huw suggests to use the leaves collected before and spread them on your lawn.

Then use your lawn mower to mix the leaves and grass clippings together to obtain a 50/50 mixture great to put on the compost heap.

## Plant field beans (_Vicia faba_)

Huw lets them grow during the winter and cut them before they flower in the spring to create a green manure and cover crop.

## Conduct a tool and seeds audit

![Bags of seeds and labels](./images/tip-7-conduct-tool-and-seeds-audit.jpg 'It’s about preparing for the new year to come. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

You want to work out what you have left in terms of seeds.

And check your tools:

- Are they working?
- Are they sharp and do they need sharpening?

When the Spring time comes, you will be ready to start your planting, seedlings and so forth.

## Mulch your beds with seaweeds

Seaweed is full of minerals.

Rain can wash the salt.

## Mulch your beds with compost

![Compost applied on a bed](./images/tip-9-mulch-beds-with-compost.jpg 'It’s the ideal time to put compost on your beds. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

## Continue planting (if you own a greenhouse or a polytunnel)

![A thick bed of vegetables](./images/tip-10-continue-planting.jpg 'Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

Continue planting allows us to keep the soil full of life as the plants grow.

Don’t forget to water the indoor beds!

## Green tomato Chutney

## Wash your polytunnel and greenhouse

Why? It will let a lot more light in.

When? In November.

## Propagate your plants

![A blackcurrant stem](./images/tip-13-propagate-new-plants.jpg 'Propagation of your blackcurrant and gooseberry happen now. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

When you want to multiply your blackcurrants or other berry bushes,

- Cut the stems that have grown tall at the bottom of the plant

  ![A stem being cut](./images/tip-13-propagate-cut.jpg 'Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

- Plant them in a dedicated bed.

During winter, they will root and you will be able to transplant them where you want in the spring.

You can also do this in a pot to sell. This can be a source of money to buy seeds.

:::tip Personal note

I will do that with my gooseberry bush that has grown big and I want to get more of them next year.

## Do something with the container full of compost

If you grow anything in containers, you can toss the used compost back into the compost heap and mix it well with the rest.

## Conduct an infrastructure audit

Review of the state of:

- your beds
- your watering system
- your fence
- your gates

Some things maybe need replacing or repairs. It’s the perfect time to do it because you’ve got the time!

## Expand your growing area

It can be:

- creating new beds
- planting fruit trees
