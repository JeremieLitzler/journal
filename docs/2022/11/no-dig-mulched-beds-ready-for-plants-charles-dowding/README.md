Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding's channel. You can watch it using [this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC44Oyune_w).

In this very short vlog, the two lessons are:

- when you get the compost before the new year, the compost will become smooth, ready to be sown in the spring.
- using a rake, you remove any weed seeds that may think they can have a go!

That's it!
