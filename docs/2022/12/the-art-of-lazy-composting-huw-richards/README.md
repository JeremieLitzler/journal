Sometimes, we think of making compost as a complex process, but, in reality, itâ€™s easy to produce high-quality compost.

Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!
I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richardsâ€™s channel.

## What is compost

To start off, letâ€™s define compost: itâ€™s the breakdown of organic matter into beautiful rich humus.

## The few key things about lazy composting

### You need bins of 1 meter long

Why? It isnâ€™t going to warm up as easily as in a dalek size bin. It needs a larger size bin to be able to build up the warmth.

That warmth and heat help to break down the material.

### The ingredients

![A detailed list of green and brown material](./images/green-versus-brown-material.jpg 'Credits: image taken from Huw Richardâ€™s vlog')

You will typically add:

- green material: grass, vegetable waste, coffee groundâ€¦
- brown material: dead leaves, wood, cardboardâ€¦

:::tip About grass clipping
Apply it in a thin layer (2â€“3 cm maximum) because it can get sludgy if too thick.
:::

:::tip Personal note
I have found that mixing grass clippings with wood dust helps build a thin compost and helps to avoid the sludge.
:::

## Ratio of green and brown

Huw tries to go for a 1 part green for 2 parts brown.

But, with lazy composting, he doesnâ€™t overthink it. **But you will need to _follow one key rule_**.

## You need diversity

Two or three ingredients arenâ€™t enough.

The more you add diverse sources of material, the more balance the compost will be in terms of pH and nutrients.

## When a bin is full

The only thing to do: press on the material to compact it a little.

Put on some boots, climb in the bin and jump!

:::warning Jumping in the compost bin
Donâ€™t do it if you didnâ€™t build a strong structure ðŸ¤£
:::

Finally, cover the compost with cardboard to keep some rainfall off the compost pile. You want moisture but you donâ€™t have anaerobic environment.

## When is lazy compost ready

It will take longer, because it doesnâ€™t get as hot.

So instead, two to three months, it will take between six and eight months.

Huw uses the technique of smelling the compost: if it smells like the forest floor, then itâ€™s ready.

Then you can apply it to the beds as a cover for winter.

## What about rats

You will get rats if you put in cooked food, diaries and bread in the compost bin.

And wouldnâ€™t you prefer having them in the compost bin or your food storage?

## How many compost bins

Three bins appears to be a good target:

- one is usable for the garden
- one is full and is starting to break down
- one is being filled

Therefore you will have compost available most of the time!
