Succession planting the act to sow and plant another crops following the harvesting of a previous one.

Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!
I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards's channel.
You can watch it using [this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8ivP0opZTE).

## Tip for sprouted garlic who comes up early in spring

Covering the ground with compost will help nourish the garlic.

## What can follow garlic

Huw sowed mustards, rocket salads and radishes.

## Share excess yields with neighbors and friends

When you grow your own food and you have excess, it is a great idea to share it, make exchanges or even donate.

It is really a value that needs to expand.

## What about intercropping

I find that some crops, like lettuce and strawberries, struggle with pests, named slugs.

I have tried in the past growing shallot around strawberries and I think it worked to keep the slugs away, far better than ash, beer traps or egg shells.

Kathleen Henderson, [from Roots and Boots](https://rootsandboots.com), shared in [an article on the topic](https://rootsandboots.com/intercropping-lettuce-with-garlic/) listing the advantages of intercropping lettuce and garlic in three points:

> 1. increased yield: grow more in less space
> 2. weed control: vegetable like lettuce help to block out weeds around slower growing plants
> 3. pest management: intercropping increases biodiversity in the garden, which can help to confuse harmful insects

My favorite benefit is clear the third one.

What is your experience on the topic?
