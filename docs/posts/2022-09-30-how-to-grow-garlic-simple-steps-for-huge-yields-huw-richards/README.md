Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!
The following are the notes I took watching the video published on Huw Richards's channel.
You can watch it using [this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmCBTd_qCh0).

## 3 things to know before growing garlic

1. Garlic exists in 3 categories: sofneck, hardneck and elephant
2. Garlic is very hardy crop demanding very little attention after planting
3. The green stem can be consummed! See below...

### Elephant garlic

It is considered as a perenial crop.

There are massive, compared to the regular soft or hardneck garlic.

### Hardneck garlic

This category tends to have larger cloves and is said to be tastier than softneck garlic.

However the bulbs don't last as long as softneck garlic.

Also, hardneck are better suited for cold climates.

Finally, hardneck garlic produced some beautiful scapes (the top of stem that will flower and that you need to cut off and eat!)

### Softneck garlic

Even if they produce smaller bulbs, there are more cloves in one head.

If you live a warmer climate, softneck garlic is a good choice.

## Planting

### When

It starts from mid-october and mid-december.

Any earlier and you may loose your plants over a really cold winter, if they have developped too much.

:::note Personal thought
That probably means that planting from mid-september (like [Charles Dowding suggested](../2022-09-28-grow-garlic-charles-dowding/README.md)) may be only possible under a polytunnel or greenhouse.
:::

Any later, you risk your bulbs to underdevelop.

### Spacing

You can plant each clove quite close to each other, between 7 cm to 10 cm.

### How

It is easy:

- Prepare the soil with compost.
- Use a large stick.

- Press down the stick to make a hole 5 cm deep
- Set the clove with the bottom first (where it was attached to the bulb)

## Growing

The most important thing is the plant focuses its energy on the bulb, not the flowering stem (see [above](#hardneck-garlic))
