In this vlog, Charles explains how to start No Dig.

## Definition of mulch

Mulch is anything that covers the surface you apply it to in order to keep the light out.

## Where to start the No Dig bed

It can be a very weedy area, a lawn.

## What do you need

You will need:

- cardboard, because it is the cheapest covering material
- wool
- compost

If you don't have any weed, you are rare lucky person. Most of us will start from a weedy patch of land.

In the following notes, we will see how Charles will free us so much time in our gardening.

Weeding is killer and all the time used to weed is not the time to grow strong and healthy vegetables.

And Charles's method leaves the soil undisturbed, which is essential for a life-riched soil.

The weeds are not pulled, they stay there and eventually, they give up growing.

Charles put it nicely: if you try to dig out the weed, they will be hurt but they will have _the will to grow more_ and you will harm your soil.

### About the cardboard

You can find easily for free. But:

- use a brown cardboard, not the shiny ones that contain plastic
- remove the tape and staples, if any
- avoid cardboard with ink, unless you are sure it is vegetable-based ink.

## How to build a No Dig bed

### The first application

You will need to delimit your bed area and the pathways.

Then apply a layer of cardboard over it, making sure there is no gap. Indeed, the weeds will find their way if you are wary about the cardboard position.

Finally, spread a 10 cm layer of compost on top.

### Maintain an edge

An edge is anything that cover about 20 cm extra more space than you bed is taking.

It will help to keep the grass to jump the rich soil of your bed.

You can use small wood beams and cardboard like show below.

### You need up to 3 or 4 cardboard applications

When the weeds start to grow through the first layer of cardboard on the pathways, it is time to pull the weeds, if it is easy, and apply another layer of cardboard.

Always make sure to overlap the piece of cardboard.

Each layer is applied about every 6 weeks, unless the weeds have died.

### Tire out the weeds by removing the small shoots

It is possible to remove all weeds with time and patience.

Patrol around the garden where you put the cardboard, pull out the young shoots of weeds and the parent root will die at one point.
