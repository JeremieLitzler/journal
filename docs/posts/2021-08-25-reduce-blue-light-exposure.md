## How to adjust blue light on Windows 10

It is easy, you just need to [activate _Night time_](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-10-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136).

## How to adjust blue light on Android

On Android, at least on version 10, we have what we call _Eye Comfort_.

It works similarly to Windows 10:

- you activate the option
- you adjust it: personally, I set to the maximum !

You might also notice that I use the _Dark mode_. That also helps, but not everyone likes it. It is a matter of taste..
