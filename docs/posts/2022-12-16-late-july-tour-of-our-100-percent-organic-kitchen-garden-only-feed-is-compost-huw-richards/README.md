The garden produces a lot around midsummer. Let’s look at what Huw has to share.

Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!
I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel.

## Onions

Growing onions from seed is pretty hard.

Huw transplanted the seedlings early April, two weeks after sowing.

## Brassicaceae

![Beds of Brassicaceae](./images/cabbage-beds.jpg 'In the frond, we have the Brussels sprouts and in the back kale and other long-term varieties. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

You should mix long-term and short-term varieties so you can free up space in your beds when you can remove the short-term ones.

Dedicate a bed for long-term varieties.

:::tip Why does Huw not net the Brassicaceae?
He finds it ugly.

But, if you want to protect the plants from the pest, Huw has experienced the case where a bird will still get under the mesh and get stuck…

If you go away for some time, then nobody will check up daily on the net.

Huw checks every 2 to 3 days the plants for cabbage white caterpillars.
:::

## Squash

They need warm weather and a long period of temperatures around 15 °C won’t help them.

## Beans

![Runner beans flowering](./images/runner-beans.jpg 'These are emperor runner beans. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

If you’re in a climate like the UK, you can have rust on the leaves and for small plants, it can become a problem for their growth.

![Leaves with rust](./images/rust-runner-beans.jpg 'Rust is a disease that you will find on the leaves when the weather is damped. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

## Broad beans

![Broad beans](./images/broad-beans.jpg 'Those broad beans look tired. One last harvest and they go on the compost bin. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

They don’t like the damp and cool weather. Rust will infect the plants in such weather.

## Saving seeds

![Leaks flowering](./images/leaks-bolting.jpg 'Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

It’s a important job to become self-sufficient to grow your own crops.

In July, you can get leak and spinach seeds.

![Perpetual spinach](./images/perpetual-spinach-bolting.jpg 'Huw doesn’t worry about cross-pollination. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

## Beetroot

Huw transplants them around that time of the summer.

## Leaks

![A bed of young leaks](./images/bed-of-leaks.jpg 'Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

Huw transplants them around that time of the summer.

They usually replace the cabbage like kale.

## Wildlife and pollinators

If it happens that you have a nest of bumble bees, preserve it!

It’s so beneficial to the garden.

A bumble bee’s nest is usually found in the ground. So watch out before you tramp it…

## Swiss chard

They need watering otherwise they will bolt after 3 to 4 weeks of dry weather.

:::tip What does bolting mean in vegetables?
Bolting is the term applied to vegetable crops when they prematurely run to seed, usually making them unusable. A cold spell or changes in day length initiates this behavior.

:::

You can still use the leaves.

## Salads

![A bed of various salads](./images/lettuce-bed.jpg 'Flowers of lettuce last only a few hours before they close. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

Lettuce will bolt easily.

However, Huw talked about a variety well known in Asia that doesn’t bolt as easily. I will put the name here once I get the answer from him in the vlog.

## Sweet peas

![Several varieties of flowering sweet peas](./images/sweet-peas-of-different-colors.jpg 'If you need ornamentals and want to eat them, grow various varieties of sweet peas for a colorful garden. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

Huw loves the fragrance of the sweet pea flowers in the early evening.

And pollinators will love the bed where they’re planted.

## Polytunnel in July

At this time of the year, you will find that the jungle is on!

![Green tomatoes](./images/tomatoes.jpg 'To protect the tomatoes, growing them under cover is a good idea. Credits: image taken from Huw Richard’s vlog')

You can plant tomatoes under the polytunnel.

Personally, I grow them without any protection. This year 2022, I haven’t taken care of them and the drought this past summer was really too hard to keep up with the watering.

## What else

The end of July and early August is not only the time of harvest, but also the time to perform a well-planned succession of crops to get the most of the same area.

Also, you shouldn’t worry too much about crops rotation because it will save you a lot of hassle.

It might not be true to all the gardens. You will need to find what works best for you.

I have tomatoes in the same bed for eight years.

I have planted potatoes randomly (basically, where I had space) and I have very likely planted in the same place again. This year, we even had volunteered potato plants from an area where we had some last year.
