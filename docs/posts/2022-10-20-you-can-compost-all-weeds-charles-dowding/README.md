Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!
The following are the notes I took watching the video published on Charles Dowding's channel.
You can watch it using [this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gVKmSO4LQ0Q).

## Can you put weeds in your compost heap

Yes. Even the ones with seeds.

## What is the catch

To kill the seeds, you will have to heat above 50-55Â°C to prevent the seeds to germinate.

But the roots or leaves on weeds don't.

## How do you heat a compost

You follow the proper ratio of fresh green and carbon materials with enough water (but not too much) until the compost is ready.

:::tip Tip from Charles
To keep the warmth in a pallet heap, put cardboard around the inside of the heap.
