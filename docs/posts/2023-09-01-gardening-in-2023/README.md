## Compost heaps

I made 2 heaps:

- one for the compost toilets
- one for the kitchen and garden wastes

## Autumn leaf harvest

### October 30th and 31st, 2022

- I picked up 4 trailers full of plane tree (_Platanus Platanos_)
- The girls liked emptying the trailer, they loved rolling into the stack of leaves afterwards ;)

### November 27th

- I picked up 2 trailers full of some small leaves tree (???) in Saint-Jean-De-Muzols
- We, the twins and I,
  - applied more cardboard to the patways.
  - added some large borage (_Borago officinalis_) to the kitchen compost

### December 11th, 2022

- I picked up 2 trailers full of some small leaves tree (???) in Saint-Jean-De-Muzols.
- I finished filling up the kitchen compost with borage as all the plants had been _cooked_ by the -5Â° C that weekend.
  - I need to build up another compost bin!

## Garlic

### October 31st, 2022

- I planted about 130 garlic seeds (equivalent to 821 grams) in various areas of the garden in order to evaluate what the garlic likes most.
- The garlic seeds was purchased from our main organic food store, because it was cheap and available.

### November 20th, 2022

- I see garlic coming out! Too early, isn't it?

### December 11th, 2022

- The garlic that has come out is resisting the frost. Will it last?
  - I still need to plant planting some more (where the tomatoes usually go)

## Strawberries

### November 6th, 2022

- We planted them in the well-nurished compost under the oak tree.

## Broad beans

### November 13th, 2022

- We planted them along the fancing where the Kury squash grew this year.
- My goal is to use the fence to hold the broad beans in the spring.

### December 11th, 2022

- The top of the bean are out... Is it a problem with frost? I'm going to wait and see.
  - Meanwhile, I will plant more in the bed where we planted the climbing beans 2 years ago.

## Nettles

### October 3rd

- I used some leaves and roots to prepare a tincture.

### November 13th, 2022

- I had to clean up the nettles as they were very numerous.
- I tooks some of the roots out and put it on the compost heap.
