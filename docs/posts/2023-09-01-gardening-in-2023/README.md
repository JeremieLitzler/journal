## Compost heaps

I made 2 heaps:

- one for the compost toilets
- one for the kitchen and garden wastes

## Autumn leaf harvest

### October 30th and 31st, 2022

- I picked up 4 trailers full of plane tree (_Platanus Platanos_)
- The girls liked emptying the trailer, they loved rolling into the stack of leaves afterwards ;)

## Garlic

### October 31st, 2022

- I planted about 130 garlic seeds (equivalent to 821 grams) in various areas of the garden in order to evaluate what the garlic likes most.
- The garlic seeds was purchased from our main organic food store, because it was cheap and available.

## Strawberries

### November 6th, 2022

- We planted them in the well-nurished compost under the oak tree.

## Broad beans

### November 13th, 2022

- We planted them along the fancing where the Kury squash grew this year.
- My goal is to use the fence to hold the broad beans in the spring.

## Nettles

### October 3rd

- I used some leaves and roots to prepare a tincture.

### November 13th, 2022

- I had to clean up the nettles as they were very numerous.
- I tooks some of the roots out and put it on the compost heap.
