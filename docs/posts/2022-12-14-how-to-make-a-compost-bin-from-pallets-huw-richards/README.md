It’s easy to make your own. Start hunting for the pallets and you will be done in no time!

Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!
I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel.

## What do you need

Huw showcased a build with ready-to-use wood.

I will describe you a method with pallets

The material lists:

- 4 pallets
- A few stainless steel screws or a sturdy wire of about 4 m.

The tools:

- A handsaw or an electrical saw
- An electric screwdriver

## How to build the version with screws

1. Remove the side feet of 2 pallets
2. Screw the modified pallets to the unmodified pallets using the 3 wood blocks.
3. Done!

I will add the pictures when I build it this way. The idea just came when I watched Huw’s vlog.

## How to build the version with the wire

1. Remove the side feet of 2 pallets.
2. Cut 8 pieces of 50 cm of wire.
3. Tie the wire around the top and bottom of each corner in the same way as the screwing method.
4. Done!

## Comments from Huw in this vlog

I found the following interesting:

- With Huw’s build or mine, you don’t need to dig the corners in the ground. The bin simply rests on it.

- Just like Huw, I prefer screws rather than nails.

  - If you do use screws, maybe, I will go a bit further, use stainless steel screws, so that, if you take the bin apart, they won’t break on you from rusting.

- Setup a _tool share_ with your neighborhood
  - List the tools each person has
  - Share the tools when needed.
