 26s Poemakers composting 2s keto, growing great vegetables, it's not only vital for no dig, it's just vital for growing one wonderful healthy plants, giving lots of growth and a high efficiency of output per time invested
 So it's worth spending time making some decent compost because it has a multiplier effect all the way along down the line
 And for me, because they're the focus of the garden, I actually put them in the middle
 We got vegetables and everything going on there
 So it's very convenient when you've got your heat reasonably central, because then it's less time needed for bringing stuff to them, which is the main input of time
 It's quicker when you wheel it out because the volume has gone down so much
 So I start in bay number two in February and we then turn that to the right sometime in May
 And then the second heap starts in bay three, and it's turned into bay two
 And the third heap is in bay four, goes into bay three, and so on
 So this is now our fifth heap of the year, which is going to be turned when it comes ready, which will be actually only in December
 Now, into that bay there
 We'll move the stuff out from there
 So it's just turned once into an empty bay next to it
 And turning is just about introducing some more air
 And that's what the roof is about, keeping out too much rain, which otherwise displaces air
 Air is so much a key ingredient, as in oxygen, to feed bacteria, which are doing a lot of a breakdown here
 But I don't want only bacteria
 There's also fungi in here doing breakdown, and if you can stop it getting too hot, you keep a decent amount of fungi
 The hotter you go, the more bacteria you tend to have
 And that's why I keep an eye on the temperature
 And I've got the thermometer here, actually, which is currently reading 55, 56 integrated
 1s And that's actually pretty good plat on the back
 It's about keeping the balance of brown and green fairly correct
 If you fill it with too much green, you get a lot of heat and it also goes a bit soggy
 So I've got a little tool here which I you can push down and then I pull it up and it gives us an idea
 If I can get it on the current heat
 This one actually doesn't work quite so well because there's so many fibers in here
 I'm lifting a huge amount of material to get this out and you can see it's steaming as well
 So it just gives an idea of what's going on in this heap
 1s I'll just shake that off
 These tools, by the way, if you have a not very big heap and you don't want to turn, that's a useful tool because as it pushes down in, these blades close and then when you pull up, they open again
 So if we now move on, that's the current heat, which has been going for about a month
 And when I say green and brown, it's got green is like fresh leaves, anything fresh, really, including actually fresh manure and coffee grounds are green because they're quite high
 Nitrogen and brown is any old woody stuff, which includes paper, cardboard, twigs, wood chips, if you have some, but not too many and preferably a bit decomposed
 And soil is also a brand, so balancing all of those give us something
 1s Like this
 We hope so
 This heap, I've got all the dates written up here so that's always useful for reminder
 Started 3 August, finish September
 We're now the 23 October
 And this was turned on the 11 October
 So that's just twelve days ago
 And this heap on average since the median of these two dates is around the 20 August
 So this heap is only two months old compost
 And look at this
 The difference compared to what I just showed you before, so you can see it's still steaming, it's still warm
 It was warm when we turned it around
 45 50 centigrade
 That's 151 2025 Fahrenheit and that's starting to break down nicely
 And then if we go on one here so this composition is now older again
 This was made middle of June to late July
 Turned in here on the 7 September
 So this is a three and a half, four months old compost
 It's really starting well, basically that's usable compost
 Now, I'd be very happy to put this on the ground even though if you look at the top you can see bits of wood
 This is from the woody bits we deliberately put in because fibrous bits like that of woody stuff, Lignier stuff keep the structure of the heap and stop it getting too airless
 That thing about oxygen always in here and that relates actually to moisture so much
 And the roof has really helped, I feel, this year
 We've had quite a lot of rain recently and this would definitely be getting soggy
 1s This heap now was made between May 1 and middle of June
 So this is five or six months old
 And, you know, it's actually almost starting to look a bit sore like partly because of the soil we put in, which I've got a big heap in reserve
 And that really helps actually, since I've been putting a bit more soiling
 The texture has got more friable
 And this is the oldest heap of wool here
 Quite hard to get to the bottom, but I just can get enough to show you what's going on
 I mean, any gardener would be very happy with that
 I certainly am
 And I'll put it on without any siblings, just on the ground, because there are still some lumps, especially where it's a bit dry on top
 But I would say the moisture levels looking good, actually
 And this compost is only seven months old
 If you can manage to make compost like this, you'll be so happy
 But in a small garden, do bear in mind it won't be quite not so easy actually here
 Obviously there's more material needed to fill these bays
 This area is serving a garden of three quarters of an acre, or 3000
 That's quite a big chunk of ground to feed
 1s Well, actually, not a huge amount
 This week
 I make in a year about six tons of compost, which includes material I bring in, including spent hops from a brewery brought down by a friend, the coffee grounds
 Last week, we even went to mowed the neighbour's lawn
 You know, it's like, hey, she was happy
 And I just wanted more ingredients for the heap, so I'm bringing in some stuff, but I reckon about three quarters probably is coming from the garden here
 So if you got a smaller garden, you'd want a much smaller heap
 And that's where, like, the plastic containers that you can actually just lift off when they're full of very good
 And if you allied one of those to a tool like that and just turn it every so often to keep the air in there and keep it mixed, because those plastic containers do get rather watertight and holding the moisture and can go
 Soggy if you're not careful, if you get soggy compost, a really good remedy is put in some scrumpled paper of any kind, just scrump it up loosely, put it in and then mix it up a bit with your soggy ingredients, say, with something like that
 That will really help
 And it's only towards the end that you will find any worms
 I haven't actually noticed anything doing this now, but last time I was in here I was seeing worms and I find that they do come in towards the end
 Most of the first three heaps is still too warm for them and then as it cools down, you start to get worms
 But that's another story, because worm compost does not work like this
 It's just degraded or decomposed by worms
 This is about, more than anything about bacterial decomposition
 And the one other type is fungal decomposition, which would be like leaf mold, for example, because that's just woody stuff breaking down very slowly
 And you can make lovely compost from wood chips, but it takes about two years
 So this is compost making, taking about six to eight months
 And almost everything you can see here will be on homemakers beds by Christmas
