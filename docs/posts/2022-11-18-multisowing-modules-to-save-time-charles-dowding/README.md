## Fill the tray with compost

Use a fine compost will make it easier to fit the compost in the small module cells.

Follow those steps:

- pour the compost in the cells
- push down with your fingers on the compost into the cells
  - it will hold more moisture
  - the compost will hold together better when you prick out the seedling
- create little holes where you will drop the seeds

## How deep should you sow

It’s best not to sow to deep (no more than 2 cm) so the seeds can come out.

## Peas

Put 2 or 3 seeds per cell.

Push the peas a little bit deeper than the rest.

## Radish

Put 4 or 5 seeds per cell.

The more you put in each cell, the smaller the radishes.

## Beetroot

Put 4 or 5 seeds per cell.

It’s hard to sow beetroot direct because the seedlings are prone to pest attack.

When you have grown them in modules, they tend to resist better.

## Onion

For onions, put about 6 seeds per cell.
For spring onions, put 2 more per cell.

## Wrapping up

Cover with compost the holes and firm it before watering well.

The compost needs to be fully moist.
