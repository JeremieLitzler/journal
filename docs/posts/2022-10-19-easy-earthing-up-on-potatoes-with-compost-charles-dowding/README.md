Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!
The following are the notes I took watching the short video published on Charles Dowding's channel.

## What is "earthing up potatoes"

It is the process of covering with soil the potatoes to protect them from the light of the sun (otherwise, they turn bad) and therefore helping the plant produce more potatoes.

## What does Charles suggest

He uses **dry compost** and pours it on top of the plant using a bucket.

The dry compost is key so it can fall to the bottom of the plan stem.

:::tip Personal note
That means not doing it on a rainy day ;)
:::

To finish, follow up with a watering if no rain is due by the next day.
