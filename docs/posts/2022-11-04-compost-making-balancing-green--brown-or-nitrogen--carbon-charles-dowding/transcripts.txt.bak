Building a heap of composite is an art.It's an art as much as a science.Difficult to be too scientific about itand quantitative because the materials one isadding vary all the time.

No two gardens are the same.So the materials you will have will notbe the same as I'm adding here.That'll be perhaps broadly similarbut always subtle differences.So don't worry too much about being precise.

What I want to show you here is how Ido it and using that to illustrate the broad principles.

For example, the mix of green and brown, whichreally helps if you can get it roughly, sayhalf and half green, half and half ground. 

But what is green?What is brown?So I'll mention that with each materialI'm adding, whether it's green or brown.And I'll just preface that by sometimes in booksand talks, it's described as carbon to nitrogen balance,which rather confuses things because the proportion given is32 parts carbon to one part nitrogen.

And it's like, okay, that's the same asroughly, I estimate 60% green to 40% brown.A huge difference in those two ratios.And that's because a lot of green materials, whatI'm calling green, actually have quite a bit ofbrown in, you know, very few things are puregreen and very few things are pure brown.And that's where it comes back to being you kindof got to assess roughly and just get an ideaof the balance and then you can judge by yourfinished result how well you've done it.

2:04: If you add a lot of green, like, for example, thisis some grass I just mowed, including some quite long bitsof grass and metals and things that is mostly green.But within this grass there is see, that's like abit of old grass that went through the murder.And that's going towards being a bitbrown because it's got more stem.It's quite tough and sinewy.So although within this broadly green material,there's also a bit of brown.I mean, I would estimate that is three quartersgreen, one quarter brown, just for sake of argument.And then on top here is peaswhich I chopped with a spade.So these are some peas which Icleared from a bed this morning.They've just finished.And it's interesting to see how moldy the leavesare going mildly, which is typical of old leaves.That is fine.To put on a compost heap, I get asked often,can I put disease material on a compost heap?The answer is, for me, it's an unqualified yes.This is a heap of magic and alchemy here.There's more than science going onin the compost in my book.It's just fantastic.What the transformation that happens?And I have not noticed a problem withdiseases carrying over from the composting process.So, for example, I had lighted lakelight material, like from potatoes and tomatoes.I had rust from garlic leaves, everything goes in here.And actually, just on that note, let me mentionone of two things that I know caused concernthat's a seeding forget me not actually, which Ijust pulled up to show you.The point being there's a lot of viable seeds on there.And that's the one example ofsomething which will benefit from heat.Everything else that I'm mentioning, your heat doesn'thave to get hot to kill these diseases.They're not magic things whichcan survive forever diseases.They need a living house.Just in the case of blight, if theydon't have living tissue, the blight spores die.So they die in compost and soil.So you don't need to worry about putting that on.But with the seeds, I would put them morein the middle of a heat where there's likelyto be the most heat, there's a thistle whichis just going to see the creeping thistle.I'm handling it quite carefully and that'sfine now, but within a week ormaybe ten days, that could be seeding.We're in second week of July here andthat's classic time for thistles to develop seeds.So that's going in there.And then methyl so stingy metal, which also seeds.At this time of year, you can get a lotof seeds from a stalker of metal like this.But again, I'm very happy to put that in.I'll mention more about the heat in a minute.And then this is something elsethat's often given a bad press.Rhubarb beliefs.Yes, you can compromise.I obviously know no good reason why not.I don't know how all these sort of,I'd call them misread or misunderstandings develop.Once they've been repeated enough, then theystart to enter the general belief.So let's have a look at if I unscrew my phone.

5:23: What I want to show you ishow we are building in layers.Why build in layers?And the answer is to get an even spread.So that is some grass that we mowed yesterday.And it's actually not too visible on the edge, but wedid layer it with some brown material, which is soil.And I've actually got some miscanthouse grass.It's like a straw.It's a perennial grass that is combinedby farmers and they sell it.And that's a brown material. It's dry stem.Basically, you can see vegetable wasteletis a charged stalk and stem.There's some more peas fromwhen we were clearing before.The brown actually is not quite as visible asI'd hoped, but this is an example of brown.So rooty things and a bit of soil.And generally, although that looks pretty green, you cansee there's quite a lot of stem here.That's like pea stem.So that's where you're going towards some ofthe green has quite a bit of brown.Particularly now as we're goingfrom summer towards autumn.Spring is the height of the green season.Summer is a bit more balanced green and brown andthen autumn is more brown and winter is very brown.So you've got different seasons,you have different materials.I'm just wondering how we can get this one back in.This could be interesting becauseit's coming out of it.You can see this is like, why have a heap at all?Why not just make compost in open?And the answer is a heat will hold in thematerial, make it tinier, it'll hold in the heat.And you notice how I've got solid size here.It's often said that composite heat should haveslated sides to allow some passenger there.Air is a vital ingredient in compost making because thatis what bacteria breathe on to live and multiply.And they do a lot of thebreakdown and they're what bring the heat.This is the green, which is going tomake the heat a lot of heat.So if I put this grass on, the reason for thelaying is so that you have you can more easily portionout the green and brown and just get it evenly added.So it's never perfect, but that's a layer of green.Now we have some brown.Believe it or not, this is woodchip, which is nearly a year old.And I run the lawnmower over it.The lawnmower is a very usefultool for chopping things up.The finer you get things adding to aheat, the more quickly they will break down.And because this wood is already ten months old,it's going to break down more quickly in thecompost heap and go to quite finished compost.But I'm not worried if I getlittle bits of wood in my compost.Compost can be yeah, you can see this is kindof almost looking like compost already, which is fine.So this is very much a brown.I would say there's very little green in this edition.And this is where it's very good if you canhave a store of browns during spring and summer becausethere's a lot of green materials coming available.Here's another brand which is soil.Why soil brand?Well, it's just inert anotherdefinition of green is nitrogen.So that's fast acting, like freshmanure is green, about 3% nitrogen.So is our coffee grounds mostly, and so they'rekind of activated and urine is green, but aheap of soil will not get hot.That's one definition of green, that you put itin a heap and it will get hot.Soil does not do that.And this is just a bit of homemaker soil.I had spare, so that is a greatbrown to add, not in huge quantity.If you put too much soil, then you'llget a lot of soil add again, itdoesn't really break down into anything new.I did find some of these mostly green materials to showyou because again, I get asked a lot about this.I expect some of you all know that that's abindweed root that's going on, then I get asked, okay,it's all very well for you Charles, because you've gota big heat and it gets hot.I wouldn't put my binary roots onbecause my heap is not like that.I totally accept that point, but in myexperience, I've made small heaps as well.And these roots, they're not indestructible,we give them too much credits.I know that they seem invincible,but I assure you they're not.They're not like hydras that are goingto just bring out the compost heat.There's only so much energy in a route like that.So if you can keep it even on the edge ofthis heat, if I put it there, not so hot.If you can keep light off it while it'll betrying to grow, it'll either be trying to grow orit'll get too hot and then die from that.And as it tries to grow, it's using upits energy and then withering at the end.So I can assure you that as long as you don'tjust put a lot on the heap and leave them togrow, basically wish they would if you didn't cover them.But I'm putting on bind withcouch grass here, for example.Lovely roots of couch grass andactually really good additions for heat.There's goodness in this so that's going on there's.Bits of IV, more bindweed, all good to go.A creeping thistle, actually.It was a nice creeping thistle here.That's a perennial creeping thistle with its root.I happily put on all of that root, allgood stuff here's some of the miscalculus I mentioned.So that's old dry grass from a farm.What I've got there is actually a pretty goodgreen and brown so far, but I'm going toput this on, which is pretty much both, actually.So a shredder is a useful tool if you'vegot a big garden, I would say for probablymost allotments and allotments often get delivered.Wood chips, you're fine.It's more if you got woodymaterial that you want to compost.A shredder opens up the possibility to putin shrubs and stems and greenwood is best.Soft wood, not too dry, but it will.This was some quite dry wood, actually, andyou can see how it's broken it upinto pieces as well as cutting it.And that's all good because that exposes moresurface area to bacteria to break down.So this is actually quite a 5050 mix of green and brown.But the woody lumps in there are great forholding a bit of air in the heat.So that's another aspect ofthis brown compared to soil.Soil won't rehold air so much, but brownmaterial, woody material is very good for that.And you can see my hips are quite large.It's actually one five metersquare, roughly that's 5ft square.And I made it this size because I judged homeacres, which is a 3000 square meter, three quarter acrearea, the first of all is just one third ofthat, but there's quite a lot of grassy, woody edges.So by how much material I have, I want to makeroughly five heaps a year and that's pretty much working.So you want to balance the size of your compostheap according to your area that you have and thenfor many of you, you won't have enough area ormaterials to make a lot of compost.This is a bit like the argument of how easyis it to be selfsufficient in vegetables, how easy isit to be selfsufficient in making your own compost?Actually really quite difficult unless youget very good at scrounging.Ask your neighbors.During lockdown here, our local recycling place was closedand one or two of my neighbors kept bringingwheelbarrows of their trimmings from their garden, either stuffthat we could shred or moan grass or whatever.And yeah, I was thrilled and they were happy.So put word out that you're up forreceiving anything you hopefully will be surprised.Cafes for coffee grounds, whatever it might be.Then the question of temperature.So you can buy these compost, thermometers it'swhat they're called for, about ten pound.And don't worry if your heat doesn't get hot.You can make nice compost without a heat getting hot.But if it does get hot,it will just happen more quickly.And at this time of year, spring, summer, goinginto early autumn, there's usually enough green that itwill get hot if you got enough, if youdon't have a lot of volume, it won't again,I'm afraid that's where scrounging and having enough basicmaterial is what's necessary for heat.But if you don't, your heat will justmolder in a nice way and take longer.Like a heap of leaf mold, forexample, that often doesn't get very hot.Old tree leaves put in a heap at the endof autumn and they will gradually turn into compost.You know, everything turns into compost in the end.My definition of compost is not like perfect, it'sjust decomposed material that is all good to goon the soil, to feed soil life.That's what I'm looking for.Not the perfect, but yeah, the heat.This one's almost embarrassingly hot, actually.It's a shade over 70 degrees centigradethere, which is over 160 Fahrenheit.And that's a little bit more than thebooks recommend because when you get that hot,you're losing a bit of fungal quality.Fungi mycelia don't like it too hot.This is more bacterialdecomposition at this temperature.What I'm finding though, is that heatlike that, it doesn't last for long.It's a flash of heat.When you put on new green material.Then if I didn't add anything there for a week, say,that would drop to 60, 65, and that's a good heat.And I find the fungi actually do survivethis process that I'm doing anyway, because whenwe come to turn the heat.We turn it just once, we find alot of white threads and it smells nice.So that's encouraging you.These are all things that tell you ifyou're doing it in the best way.So that's useful just to keep an eye on it really.And watering it.I'm often asked about this as wellbecause some people say you should alwayswater your compost, water all ingredients beforeadding and that advice needs qualifying.It's not bad advice, but it doesn't apply.I would say it doesn't apply to whatI've added here on camera this afternoon.For me, all this material has got moisture in enoughthat as it breaks down like grass, that moisture inthere is quite wet or quite damp, I should say.It's not physically wet, it's moisture will comeout and keep the compost heap to agood degree of moisture, enough moisture if youhave too much moisture, that displaces air.So we come back to oxygen andthat's why overwatering is not good.We water here usually in just very dryweather, like we had a very dry Maythis year and I was watering the heats.If there wasn't enough green fresh matter,that's when you need to water.But not don't assume that you have to water.And actually I've got the roof here becauseour climate can be quite wet and again,that means too much moisture, displacing air.And since I've had the roof, which is three years now,the quality of my compost has gone up quite a bit.I'm really happy with it.I will show you the result in just a minute.I just want to say about finishing,so I put the dates up here.We started this one on the 11 June.Today it's 11 July actually, so it's exactlyone month, 30 days since we started it.I reckon normally about six weeks.But you know, this is not written in stone.These are broad focus to give you an idea.Your garden will be different.There's a rule of thumb, I reckon, to buildit and build it and build it until sayabout shoulder height and usually that's enough.But when you're building it, it's been upat this level a few times already.Then it keeps sinking and then we'll build up again.Then it keeps sinking.You're going up and down, up and down, up and down.And there comes a time when you're sort ofup here and it's been sinking quite slowly andI'll make the call at that point, right, that'senough here because it will then sink.Behind me here is where my hand is there.That's the level.Whereas when we finished this one, it was up here.So that's the heat that wefinished exactly a month ago.It's actually still hot, pretty warm.The temperature is showing 55 degrees on this onehere, still one month after it last material added.And what we do is we turn it then intothe empty bay to the right just once for me.You can ignore all thatadvice about turning frequently.I mean, you can if you want, but it's not necessary.And also people talk about making compost andevery time you turn it, it loses carbon. Well, exactly.So just don't do it very often and I findthat one turn is really worthwhile because it's a chanceto remix and get a much more even result whichwill save you time when you come to spread it.You've got lovely material then which is actually here.For example, this is compost that we finished.It was turned into here on the 11 October last year andit had been made in the heat to the left of itas you look at it, during September and early October.No, sorry.During August, actually.Yeah, that's right.It was started on September, so that was late summerheat and then on the 11 October we take theside out and turn it into the next heat andso it's been sitting there since 11 October, 11 July,and it was made mostly during August.So it's ten or eleven months oldand this is what it looks like.I'll actually tip out this bucket so you can seethe kind of consistency of what's in there and howthere are some lumps and there's some bits of twigand wood that is fine to go on the ground.It's even good because that fungal decomposition on the surfacefeeding my sealer in the saw so I don't sieveor sift that that is going to go on exactlyas you see coming out of that bucket there.There's some lovely stuff in thereand there's some quite lumpy spits. Fine.So there you have a little resume of makingcompost and go for it, make as much asyou can, whether you can make enough to feedall your cropping area and your flourish.Compost is good for flowers as well.That's to be seen. I would doubt it.I think for many of us you need to haveit up your sleeve that you can buy some compostin but it depends what you're doing here.I'm making it a year between five andsix tons and as my garden is now,I'm using rather less than I was before.I'm usually going to use about eight tons this winterso I'm not going to need a huge amount morethan what I'm making but I'm bringing in quite afew materials to make this and that is all good.
