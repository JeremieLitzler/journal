## Extract the seeds

Just scoop out the _jelly part_ where the seeds are attached

_Add image_

## Remove the _jelly part_

It can be done simply with the following steps:

- Put the seeds in a **labelled** glass
- Add some water
- Let the seeds fermented a few days to help break the jelly
- Swirl the glass every day

Once all the seeds have sunk:

- Remove the water
- Wash the seeds
- Let them dry for 2-3 weeks in direct sunlight
- Store the seeds in a closed paper bag.

## How long can we keep the seeds

Up to 5 years, if kept in a cool and dry place.
