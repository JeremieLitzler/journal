## Step 1: Base layer

Use a very fiberous material like straw or small branches.

For examples, old nettle stems work well.

It will provide enough oxygene at the base and it is key to help the microbes thrive and develop to brean down the material in the compost.

## Spent compost

It can come from buckets, module trays, hanging basket.
