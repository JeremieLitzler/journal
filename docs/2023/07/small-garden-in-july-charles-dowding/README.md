What is happening in the small garden of Charles Dowding in mid-July 2019?

Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel.

A lot of second planting happened already.

## In the first row

![Harvested red spring onions](./images/harvested-red-spring-onions.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

And some crops are finishing like Lilla onions, that can’t be stored unfortunately.

![Multi-sown leaks](./images/multi-sown-leaks.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

Leaks were planted a month ago, to take over from spinach.

![Beetroots sown early July](./images/beetroots-sown-early-july.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

Just after that, beetroots followed the harvest of early potatoes.

## In the second row

In place of the early lettuces (which gave out many kilograms of food), carrots were sown.

![New carrots sown](./images/new-carrots-sown.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

:::tip Charles recommends To harvest lettuce, Charles picks only the outer leaves so that the lettuce keep on producing and it helps the lettuce not to bolt.

![New lettuces](./images/new-lettuces.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

The above lettuces were sown on the 1st of July and planted the 24th of July. :::

In the same row, Charles planted kale, the Cavolo Nero kind. They will crop up in the fall and maybe even through the winter.

![Cavolo Nero kale](./images/cavolo-nero-kales.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

The kale replaced the early carrots, that gave out 4 kg of crops on mid-July.

![Safari French beans](./images/safari-french-beans.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

To finish the row, Charles planted French beans, following the radishes and garlic as first crops.

![Radish interplanted between garlic](./images/radish-interplanted-between-garlic.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

Charles planted French beans in between the garlic and radishes, always optimizing the space.

:::tip Rabbit protection Rabbits love young leaves and Charles uses a winter mesh to protect the crops. :::

## In the third row

More carrots, that replaced early beetroot, were sown.

![Peas grown for shoots](./images/peas-grown-for-shoots.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

Peas for shoots were replaced by Swedes (Gowrie kind).

![Growrie Swedes](./images/growrie-swedes.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

:::warning About Swede and insects The Swedes require a mesh one to prevent the summer insects to infest the crops.

![Swede affected by insects](./images/swede-affected-by-insects.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

If you don’t, the Swedes will fork and they won’t taste as good. :::

Next, Charles planted some summer crops, like:

- peppers ![Augsburger pepper](./images/augsburger-pepper.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

- aubergines
- dwarf ground cherry (Physalis)
- regular tomatoes ![Crimson crush tomatoes f1](./images/crimson-crush-tomatoes-f1.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

- cherry tomatoes
- ![Sungold tomatoes f1](./images/sungold-tomatoes-f1.jpg 'Credits: image from the vlog of Charles Dowding')

Tomatoes were planted in between spinach a few months back, always using the space when it’s available.

At the end of summer, Charles will draw lines between the tomatoes to grow the next spinach, always having something to grow.

## Conclusion

The takeaway is that you can:

- use the space when available,
- plan to sow and plant using a plan.
