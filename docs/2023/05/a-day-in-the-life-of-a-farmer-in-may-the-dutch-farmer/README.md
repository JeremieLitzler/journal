In May, it is getting serious, with a lot of crops to plant and to start harvesting.

Thanks to Moreno for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!
I wrote the following notes watching the video published on The Dutch Farmer’s channel.

## Growing food is an invaluable skill

I can't agree more with the statement that growing food yourself yields not only food for your family, but also a better understanding of the environment around.

We are stewards of this planet, meaning we shouldn't exploit it like we can see powerful coporations act.

As we are nearing summer, cherries will be ripened by the end of the month or early next month. And I have seen news articles talking about the farmers in Ardèche not knowing how to fight off the pest that detroys the ripe cherries, if not treated.

I mean, just for the sake of _producing profit_, they will spray chemicals that are known to be dangerous for our health.

Yes, the alternatives, like neeting, are much more expensive.

But do they realize that are slaves of the system which:

- impose on them to buy the chemicals
- sale the produce for almost nothing
- sale the drugs from big pharma to heal the deseases that the chemicals create...

What a vicious cycle!

So, why not learn to grow your own food? Yes, a cherry tree will take time to grow and yield a good harvest, at least, you can choose to eat healthy.

Is that not better?
