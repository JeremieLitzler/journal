## March 19th

I transplanted the sweet peas between the garlic bed located in the south of the garden.

It was hard to get the seedlings out. I was surprised about that but the roots were quite big. I managed to pull the seedlings with only a couple looses.

## March 26th

I transplanted the 4 season lettuces with the garlic bed under the almond tree.

Similarly to the sweet peas, it was hard to get the seedlings out. I had to be more careful because the stem of the lettuce were much thiner and I couldn't pull on them.

So I used the small spoon that came with the green houses.

Today, I sowed more vegetables:

- 2 tiny greenhouses of lamb's lettuce
- 2 tiny greenhouses of mesclun lettuce
- 1 tiny greenhouse of swiss chards from very old seeds, so it might not lead to successul sprouting
- 4 medium modules with watermelons
