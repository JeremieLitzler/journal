## November 6th

We planted them in the well-nurished compost under the oak tree.

## November 13th

We planted them along the fancing where the Kury squash grew this year.
My goal is to use the fence to hold the broad beans in the spring.

## November 27th

I picked up 2 trailers full of some small leaves tree (???) in Saint-Jean-De-Muzols

We, the twins and I,

- applied more cardboard to the patways.
- added some large borage (_Borago officinalis_) to the kitchen compost

Also, I see garlic coming out! Too early, isn't it?
