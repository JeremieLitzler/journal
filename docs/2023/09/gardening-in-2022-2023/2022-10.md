## October 30th and 31st

I picked up 4 trailers full of plane tree (_Platanus Platanos_)

The girls liked emptying the trailer, they loved rolling into the stack of leaves afterwards ;)

Apart from that, I planted about 130 garlic seeds (equivalent to 821 grams) in various areas of the garden in order to evaluate what the garlic likes most.

The garlic seeds was purchased from our main organic food store, because it was cheap and available.
