Take the time for your spouse.

Take the time for your children.

Take the time for you.

Balance all that and be satisfied that what you get is what you get.

Think about what you can do with a very focused mind, not going left or right when you are pulled in those directions.

No, look in front of you and work towards that goal.

Yes you see it, it is always in sight. So you can reach it.

But, don’t forget: the journey is more rewarding than the goal to reach.
It’s during the journey that you learn to reach your goal.

You may just find that the goal is as important as what you learned to get to it.

Having balanced lifestyle will help because extremes are toxic. They are the reason you go right or left, loosing focus on the Goal.

It must be adjusted often, like adding weight the wavering scale of life.

Be the master of it.
